								<center><h3>WHO WE ARE</h3></center>
							</header>
							<p> Great converter is a tailored service that wants to help UK colleges and Universities make better decisions whenever they enrol international students in the summer. We want them to instil confidence in international students because most of them do not understand what their grades are or equivalent to when visiting new countries to study, especially in the UK.
This business idea was developed on the 20th of May 2014 by three members who study in the same college (Barking and Dagenham College) namely:Roy Mugera, Daniel Jemmott and Adriana Porumb. Below is a brief description of the three members:
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li><strong>Roy Mugera:</strong> 21 years of age, currently studying a BTEC course in Business studies - extended Diploma level 3; Kenyan by origin. (On the left). </li>
							        <li><Strong>Adriana:</strong> 17 years of age, currently studying BTEC in Business Studies/Administration, Nationality-Romania.(center).</li>
                                                                <li><strong>Daniel Jemmott:</strong> 16 years of age, currently studying BTEC in Business Studies/Administration, Born in Guyana but a British citizen. (On the right).</li>
							</ol>

									<h3>WHAT WE DO</h3>
								</header>
								<p>What we do simple, we convert international grades instantly and accurately to so that colleges and Unversities may understand how international qualifications are compared to that of UK.
								We are doing this because we understand that it can be frustrating for the international student when they want to enroll for a course or apply for jobs in a new country and employers; universities/colleges find it difficult to interpret their qualifications. They visit various websites/other services to understand what their qualifications are worth or equivalent to but the results are unsatisfiying.
								Sometimes converting grades can be expensive and results of conversion may take time to arrive. </p>
